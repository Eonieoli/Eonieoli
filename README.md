# Hi there 👋
---
I am learning hard to become a software engineer.

When I was in college, I majored in electronic engineering and decided on a career path in semiconductor circuit design.

In the future, I want to study Python, C, and C++, and integrate artificial intelligence and big data technology with circuit design.

But I'm still just a "응애".
